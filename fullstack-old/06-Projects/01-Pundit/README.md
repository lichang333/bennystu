## Projects - Day One

You should now belong to a team of 3 to 4 people, with a clear concept for the MVP you're going
to be building for the next 2 weeks. The goal of the day is the same as Airbnb - Day 1:

- Write **user stories** down. You should have no more than 15. We recommend setting up a [Trello](http://trello.com) board to coordinate tasks between team members
- Open [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com) and figure out the **database schema**
- Draw **mock-ups** of *every* screen your app needs. Draw arrows between them to show how your user will move between them. This will help give you to the **unique value proposition** of your app.
- From the mock-ups, figure out the **routes**

For **each step**, ask a teacher to validate it. Rushing straight into the code is the best way to break stuff!

When starting your rails app, you **must** use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). It'll get you up and running faster.

Please download and **print** [this template for your User Stories](https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/raw/master/rails/rails-user-stories.pdf) (or ask a teacher!)
