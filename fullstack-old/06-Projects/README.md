## Projects

We are now entering the two last weeks of the program. It's your time to shine. Time is going to really fly, so make sure you are deploying in production as often as you can, and **don't neglect your front-end**! Remember, the look of your site will be the first thing people see on Demo Day.

Good luck - you're going to be amazing. Here are your milestones:

- First week, Friday 5pm: first demo to get class / staff feedback and organize your roadmap for the second week.
- Second week Thursday (7pm): rehearsal for final demo.
- Second week Friday (6pm): THE BIG DAY. Everyone is here! Press, VCs, your family! Smash it!

**Le Wagon Rails Templates**: to save time on all the boring configurations of last week, you can use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). It'll get you up and running faster.
